MATRIX -a regular arrangements 0f the elements 
a matirx A over a field k i s a rec. array  of scaler usually reprsented in follwoing form 






matrix addition and scaler addition 
let A =[aij]  and B = [bij] be two matrices with the same size say m x n 
then the sum of a x b is written as the matix obtained by adding corrosponding elements from a and b 






basic properties 
1.(A+B)+C=A+(B+C)
2.A + 0 = A = 0 + A 
3.A



5.k(A+B)=kA+kB
(k1​+k2​)A=k1​A+k2​A


THE PRODUCT OF ROW MATRIX AND A coumn matrix b=[bj]  

obtained by multiplying corrosponding
